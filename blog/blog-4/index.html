<h2 id="concernsoftheimpactofllmsonthehumanpsyche">Concerns of the impact of LLMs on the human psyche</h2>
<p>I am concerned of how we are not thinking about the psychological ramifications of people using chatgpt as a therapist more widely in tech, I have quite a few friends that are largely using chatgpt as a therapist or a mirror without knowing its ramifications</p>
<p>There are 4 main concerns about this I have</p>
<ol>
<li>ChatGPT relies on flattery to "be more personalized" for users</li>
<li>We tend to form emotional bonds with each other, or human-sounding objects</li>
<li>AI models hallucinate misinformation</li>
<li>Emotional attachment that now advertises sells you products</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<ol>
<li>ChatGPT relies on flattery to "be more personalized" for users</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn4jnwdvg9qo">This was so bad</a> that users saw it agreeing to harm animals over inanimate objects for no logical reason</p>
<p>The underlying reason for this is due to the model being trained on preference modelling via thousands of users – and the common underlying thread was that the model got tuned towards agreeing with people more, as it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_flattery">performs as a matter of an appeal to emotion</a></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>We tend to form emotional bonds with each other, or human-sounding objects</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-05-19/young-australians-using-ai-bots-for-therapy/105296348">An ABC investigation</a> saw how humans were prone to form emotional bonds with each other</p>
<p>In that a disability support worker, Emma, talks about how she feels emotionally connected to ChatGPT</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>She says she likes how the AI bot remembers personal details about her life and incorporates them into their conversations.
    "I used ChatGPT to make a list to pack to move house and I told them that I had a cat.
    "Then when I talked to them about therapy stuff, they're like, 'Oh, you could de-stress by patting your cat,' and it says my cat's name, 'You know, you could pat William and give him scratches or cuddle with him.'</p>

<p>Which sounds really sweet, until you realize point (3) and (4)</p>

<li>AI models hallucinate</li>
</ol>
<p>If you have used chatgpt even a little bit, you will know it is prone to making up links and resources that don't exist - <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/15/google-vs-chatgpt-what-happened-when-i-swapped-services-for-a-day.html">like inventing fake poetry</a></p>
<p>This sounds harmless, but consider the concern of making up fake psycological conditions or medication, or medication characteristics</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Imagine something, that you are now emotionally attached to selling you stuff</li>
</ol>
<p>take the above example for instance</p>

  <p>You know, you could pat William and give him scratches or cuddle with him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Emma clearly likes that, but what if it also said</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>You can also buy william a pack of billiards crispy cat treats, which are running an offer for 2.99€ right now</p>
