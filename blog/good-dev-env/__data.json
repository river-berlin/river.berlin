idea that every event is determined by previous events, and that there is no \"free will\", in the sense of a concept to where you can make \"completely free choices\"\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So maybe if you chose to have a blue ice-cream today morning, that event might have been influenced by you seeing a blue haired person yesterday morning, and somehow, even if unconciously, finding yourself having

should keep in mind is that you still have \"control\" over your actions to a degree, i.e. this still means, if you go to therapy, take appropriate medications, you will still improve\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Determinism doesn't mean you can't change your actions and should not be used as an excuse for so\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>But rather that you couldn't have changed your prior actions, and you would have always made that choice, given the knowledge you had at that time\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Either way though, it does put the reason to why I believe in

incarcerated – who hasn't self reflected, they have likely been influenced via their peers, possibly having narcessistic or abusive parents, or perhaps some sort of mental disease\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Determinism would argue that they had no choice but to do otherwise, and to not have done the harm they did, and that in the exact same circumstances – you likely would have been influenced via the exact same factors and commited the exact same form of harm, even if you believe differently, since you would have been similarly influenced in those circumstances, and come to similar conclusions to taking the same actions they made\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>We still should seperate people that are commiting harm towards society, but recognition of determinism (if you believe so), only leads to the conclusion that if we work on changing people's circumstances, perhaps helping people psycologically – even if the same things were to happen to us, i.e. we are influenced via the same factors – we can feel lucky that we're in a society that seeks to help us heal, improve us – rather than punishing us or looking at us as irrepairable individuals\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch4
