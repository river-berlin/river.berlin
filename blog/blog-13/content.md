# For Mo

Hey Mo!

There's this excellent article you have written ([You are not the main character](https://potluckpress.substack.com/p/you-are-not-the-main-character)), that I read, time, and time again  – admittedly, I have some self esteem issues – reading this helps me remember that I am alot more with other people

But just like it takes thousands of people to make anything great – it takes thousands of people to make anything awful

There's a [short from game of thrones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2W0nVisWla4) its a riddle about power

I like it quite a bit, This is Varys from Game of thrones telling Tyrion Lannister a riddle

<details>
  <summary>The quote, if you prefer to read it</summary>

A "cell sword" in this context is a soldier with a sword

**Varys**
> A king, A priest and a rich man – between them stands a common cell sword, each great man bids the cell sword kill the other two, who lives, who dies?

**Tyrion Lannister**
> Depends on the Cell Sword

**Varys**
> Does it?, He has neither crown, nor gold, nor favor with the gods

**Tyrion Lannister**
> He has a sword, the power of life and death!

**Varys**
> But if its swordsmen who rule, why do we pretend kings hold all the power?
> When Ned Stark lost his head, who was truly responsible, Joffery, The Executioner or something else?

**Tyrion Lannister**
> I have decided I don't like riddles

**Varys**
> Power resides where men believe it resides, its a trick, a shadow on the wall, and a very small man can cast a very large shadow

These people are rarely alone, Charlie Kirk has never been alone –he is supported, he has video editors on his side, body guards, social media personell, script writers, and of course and army of viewers to back him up – he doesn't get to spread his hateful bullshit without his kingdom

remove all that – and if it's just a person screaming into the void with that bullshit – watching that person die would horrify me, I'd say that regardless of their views they didn't deserve to die, I would say if a person was screaming that into the void they're probably a mentally ill person, someone horribly traumatized

We like to hear narratives about <u>_killing the bad guy_</u> because it makes us feel better – getting rid of that one person eliminated all of what is bad in society

But its not that simple, after Hitler died – the allied forces famously attemped [denazification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denazification)

<p style="font-size: 12px; width: 300px">
After the defeat of Nazi Germany, German civilians were sometimes forced to tour concentration camps and in some cases to exhume mass graves of Nazi victims. Nammering [de], May 17, 1945

> English writer James Stern recounted an example in a German town soon after the German surrender:

> [a] crowd is gathered around a series of photographs which though initially seeming to depict garbage instead reveal dead human bodies. Each photograph has a heading "WHO IS GUILTY?". The spectators are silent, appearing hypnotised and eventually retreat one by one. The placards are later replaced with clearer photographs and placards proclaiming "THIS TOWN IS GUILTY! YOU ARE GUILTY!"

([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denazification#Soviet_zone))

This famously didn't work out either – because there were just too fucking many nazis

The American government soon came to view the program as ineffective and counterproductive. Additionally, the program was hugely unpopular in West Germany, where many Nazis maintained positions of power. Denazification was opposed by the new West German government of Konrad Adenauer ([more here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denazification))

There's more complexity to this, and no amount that Germany can do – will ever make up for what it had done, but we try, and we really really should do so so much more

It's only when people spoke up, actively started building monuments, advocated for teaching about history in schools (see [Vergangenheitsbewältigung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vergangenheitsbew%C3%A4ltigung#After_denazification)) that things actually started to change - and germans started to realize what they did was really really fucking bad

You'll [find these stumbling blocks (stolperstein) everywhere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stolperstein) next to my house

We've dug stones throughout europe, it many streets to remind us of what _we historically did_, Which have the names of nazi victims engraved within them

We've built monuments to remind us of what we did

The large point here is that Charlie Kirk isn't _alone_, many many Americans advocate for the acceptance of school shootings (and relay kirk's values), as an acceptable thing – it's fucked up

and at the end of the day, he's just going to be replaced by another person in the vending machine of people with horrific viewpoints

and at some degree - we have to start changing people's minds, harming everyone is never an option

Or as [Martin Luther King](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence_begets_violence) put it

> Hate begets hate; violence begets violence; toughness begets a greater toughness. We must meet the forces of hate with the power of love... Our aim must never be to defeat or humiliate the white man, but to win his friendship and understanding.


or you just spiral into a cycle of violence
