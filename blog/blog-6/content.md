## Smaller orgs and more emotional happiness

So I am going to add the caveat here that nuance here does matter alot, I do think that you're likely to live a much happier life earning more than median income, [some more data here on this](https://ourworldindata.org/happiness-and-life-satisfaction), it's more against "insane power", i.e. being a politician that controls an entire country or trying to be a billionaire

Organizations often have 2 things simultaniously going on

1. Leaders at top are often given summaries of summaries – Org leaders aren't able to get departmental nuance due to the sheer complexity
2. People find themselves with a necessity of having to push and give optimistic futures to prove their self-worth to their own managers (i.e. telling "this is not possible" or "this will have concerning after-effects" comes at a career cost of not being able to prove yourself)

The bigger the organization, the more of this that occurs, the more org leaders see summaries and lack nuance

And this often comes with consequences to people's lives, and pressure to produce things that may be non-sustainable

at some degree though, it also comes with – it does also reduce your role to "chief advertiser" where you have no clue on how your product actually functions at depth - but are happy sitting at the top

compare this to someone – that truly understands the product they ship, say you are a 3d printer manufacturer, and you try understand the nuance of how code translates the model into G-code, how printer calibration is done, the nuances of the product, how the circuits work – as opposed to being the massive leader of 30 different organization with no clue on how any of those products or their supply chains work

There is alot of value in doing something small, and doing it extremely well, and alot of self-pride that can be gathered from that as opposed to, doing alot and not getting value from it

You above everything are far more likely to get into [flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)) working on perfecting a software algorithm and to make it more beautiful, to organize it's codebases, to make calibration easier – than leading something of uncumbered infinite growth and complexity.....while lacking complete nuance at any step
