<p>Now this is a generalization, and like all generalizations, it's not always true, but a thing that gets me excited to "complete" projects is to build something really tiny that works</p>
<p>and then work on making it better</p>
<p>not a "proof of concept" but like the "proof of concept of the proof of concept", building the tiniest, most important part of the project that works, and then expanding it</p>
<ul>
<li>Now you have the motivation for the project, and you have the smallest part that works ¯_(ツ)_/¯</li>
</ul>
<p>However, this does not mean compromising on the "expandability" of the project,</p>
<p>So essentially, for me, for example, perhaps when I go into the project I would recognize that eventually I would want to make a mobile app out of it, so it's still a better idea to start with react native, and then work on the web app, and then work on the mobile app</p>
<p>since rewriting the codebase from scratch here would be incredibly exhausting</p>
<p>Starting with typescript/jest and probably the "most advanced stack" can probably better early on, than having to add everything later and have it break because it just doesn't work</p>
<p>some tips on this</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Starter templates are AWESOME and save a lot of time to everyone involved</p></li>
<li><p>https://createexpostack.com/ is my goto here</p></li>
<li><p>Don't focus on perfection, everyone makes mistakes</p></li>
<li><p>Everything is a compromise and there are no perfect rules to adhere to here</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Lastly, this does not mean writing bad code, (<a href="https://minds.md/zakirullin/cognitive">I tend of think of bad code as complex code</a>), you still take a step back, maybe take a pen and paper, draw a diagram and think about how your codebase is gonna work so the next person (or when you in the future are reading it) can still understand it</p><!----></div></div><!----><!--]--><!----></div><!----><!--]--> <!--[!--><!--]--><!--]-->
