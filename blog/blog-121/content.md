# How to build a tech commune

This is a slight rant against some frustration I have been having with capitalism

I genuinely do believe that beyond this point, self-sustaining communal systems are not impossible, and would be alot more fulfilling to work/live in for the average person

The reason why, I view systems of corporate interest succeeding is because of 2 reasons

1. Organizing people in anarchistic systems is very difficult, Heirarchical systems don't have conflict (especially when everyone is incentiviced to make the system succeed - and not lose their job)

2. The housing market, construction and other infrastructure, to build, and maintain, is extremely expensive, people are expensive, skilled people are extremely expensive


But, something has changed

Like okay, this is not an advocacy for LLMs, and I don't believe the hype with regard to them in specific, but I really really do believe the hype of LAMs (Language action models)

I really do think that we can have it so that, all agriculture production is completely automated, so a small commune, where most of the contruction is done by machines, where the farmland is maintained by machines and the structures themselves, and things like cooking, cleaning, organizing is done far more by machines than humans

This leads to a collapse of the need for heirarchical systems, cause you don't need so many people to run and maintain the very systems, you can successfully have a few people running the commune and have things be self-maintained

anyway, the guide is this


+ An infinite loop of
  - Build fully robot arms, on wheels, which lekiwi nearly already does
  - Build a simulation tool, that shows how entire structures can be automated with those arms
  - Build those simulations
