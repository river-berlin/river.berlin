important part of the project that works, and then expanding it\n\n- Now you have the motivation for the project, and you have the smallest part that works ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\n\nHowever, this does not mean compromising on the \"expandability\" of the project,\n\nSo essentially, for me, for example, perhaps when I go into the project I would recognize that eventually I would want to make a mobile app out of it, so it's still a better idea to start with react native, and then work on the web app, and then work on the mobile app\n\nsince rewriting the codebase from scratch here would be incredibly exhausting\n\nStarting with typescript/jest and probably the \"most advanced stack\" can probably better early on, than having to add everything later and have it break because it just doesn't

makes mistakes\n\n- Everything is a compromise and there are no perfect rules to adhere to here\n\nLastly, this does not mean writing bad code, ([I tend of think of bad code as complex code](https://minds.md/zakirullin/cognitive)), you still take a step back, maybe take a pen and paper, draw a diagram and think about how your codebase is gonna work so the next person (or when you in

Svelte more than React (it's store management)\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>The developer experience of svelte is miles better than react, apart from pre-planned request layout structures and less cognitive work on that area\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And that's it, React projects get into state-hell very easily, and then users are forced to use alternative options such as https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand or https://jotai.org/\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This is due to the fact that react by default does not have any \"Global state storage\" by default, so unless you are relying on the above mentioned libary – you likely will have to create a huge amount of inheritance and prop-drilling - which quickly gets messy and becomes a maintenance nightmare\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>for example, lets say you have a simple react function with children\u003C/p>\n\u003Cpre>\u003Ccode class=\"tsx language-tsx\">function App() {\n    return (\n        &lt;div&gt;\n            &lt;h1&gt;App&lt;/h1&gt;\n            &lt;Child

)\n}\n\u003C/code>\u003C/pre>\n\u003Cp>and the way you use it is\u003C/p>\n\u003Cpre>\u003Ccode class=\"tsx language-tsx\">function App() {\n    const [count, setCount] = useState(0)\n    return (\n        &lt;div&gt;\n            &lt;h1&gt;App&lt;/h1&gt;\n            &lt;Child count={count} setCount={setCount} /&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    )\n}\n\u003C/code>\u003C/pre>\n\u003Cp>now imagine doing this for a complex state driven project, it clearly doesn't work\u003C/p>\n\u003Cpre>\u003Ccode class=\"tsx language-tsx\">function App() {\n    const [count, setCount] = useState(0)\n    const [place, setPlace] = useState(\"alaska\")\n    const [name, setName] = useState(\"river\")\n    // 30 different states to load from\n\n    // 30 different props to pass down\n    &lt;UserRepresentation count={count} setCount={setCount}, place={place} setPlace={setPlace}, name={name} setName={setName} /&gt;\n}\n\u003C/code>\u003C/pre>\n\u003Cp>This is probably not a \"realistic\" example, but in a practical sense, it is a nightmare to manage\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So people turn to other libraries like zustand\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>here you use something similar to\u003C/p>\n\u003Cpre>\u003Ccode

up&lt;/button&gt;\n}\n\u003C/code>\u003C/pre>\n\u003Cp>This is indeed better, since it makes the stores \"global\" instead of something chained down\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Svelte manages this via svelte stores, which I feel are alot alot more intuitive, and because they come pre-packaged in svelte, it is one less additional library to use\u003C/p>\n\u003Cpre>\u003Ccode class=\"svelte
