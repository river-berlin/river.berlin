<p>I had a meal in a restaurant the last night, the person serving (I think he was the restaurant owner) was telling a restaurant cook about how his food wasn't good, and a new employee on how "he runs a tight ship" to a new employee and telling him that he would rather the new employee leave than not follow exactly what he says</p>
<p>This has been running on my mind with a few events, namely <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Sep/15/how-to-succeed-in-mrbeast-production/">Simon Willson's blog post on how Mr Beast works</a>, Professor Ellie Anderson's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qikrYBd4tw">cover of "The Burnout Society"</a> and Why <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2MnwhjncjA">Marco Pierre white gave back his Michelin Stars</a></p>
<p>At it's core, phew, I get that the restaurant industry is very hard to run, cooking for so many people is probably very difficult, maintaining, running around</p>
<p>and the truth is I would pay more if I could afford to pay more</p>
<p>idk, at its core, I would, much rather the Chef, and the cooks and the waiter go back happily to their families, I mean, it's okay for you to make mistakes - and idk, if the food is a little bit off-taste, that's okay for me</p>
<p>In one of the local asian grocery stores I frequented, I remember the store owner's hanging their 8-10 year old kid's pokemon drawings, I loved them - they're line drawings, not the best drawings, but they made the grocery store more "human" to me, they weren't the "best" drawings, the store owner could've definitely put up expensive high-tier drawings to make the place more pretty, butâ€¦I am kinda glad he didn't</p>
<p>Things don't have to be "perfect" for me to enjoy them</p>
<p>Ellie Anderson's video above does go into how this "grind" ends up having an aftermath of depression, because of-course it will</p>
<p>idk, dude take your time, life is difficult, I get it, it's cool to take more time to cook your food, take 30 minutes more - it's okay, this restaurant is beautiful and I am honored to have you cooking for me and another person is serving me - thank you so so much for everything</p>
<p>I want you to go home happy to your kids, I want you to have a happy family and a good relationship and other hobbies beside being a chef, I want you to enjoy life, we're chill dude</p>
