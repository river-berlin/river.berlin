# There is always hope

> Lucifer : I am anti-life, The beast of judgement, the dark at the end of everything, What will you be then dream lord?
>
> Still with us Dream?
>
> There are no more moves, What can survive the anti-life?
>
> Dream : I......
> I am hope
>
> Hope?
> Well lightbringer, its your move
> What is it that kills hope?

> In fearful day, in raging night,
> With strong hearts full, our souls ignite.
> When all seems lost in the War of Light,
> Look to the stars, for hope burns bright!"

What I am battling right now internally is a sense of nihilism, Trump's actions of horribility have – been painstaking, pin pricks to the chest, but so many of them, bit by bit tearing things

But that doesn't mean things are all bad, it's weird, I don't want to be dismissive of anyone's emotions as I am saying this

His actions of systematically, [sending innocent people to prisons in foriegn nations](https://apnews.com/article/kilmar-abrego-garcia-release-jail-deportation-trial-c17d7ba538530a668e4f55358e83c0fe) is genuinely awful

and it also bothers me how, well, [grok has become a full grown nazi-praising-bot](https://gizmodo.com/round-them-up-grok-praises-hitler-as-elon-musks-ai-tool-goes-full-nazi-2000626156), this comes after Elon's famous hitler-salute (also in the prior lined source)

anyway, these events have left me with a bitter taste in my mouth, they have made me lose direction – Is anyone trustworthy?, What can I believe?

There is a generic reminder of things, that are worth believing in for the time being

- American homicide rates have historically [decreased since the 1990s](https://www.macrotrends.net/global-metrics/countries/usa/united-states/murder-homicide-rate)

<img src="/blog/blog-10/homicide_rates.png" alt="Bar chart displaying annual homicide rates from 1990 to 2021. Rates were highest between 1990 and 1994, then declined steadily until 2014. From 2015 onwards, rates fluctuated slightly before spiking sharply in 2020 and 2021, with a notable increase to 6.81 per 100,000 people in 2021. A timeline slider below the chart shows the overall trend decline and recent uptick." width="500" style="text-align: center; margin: auto;"/>


- Exteme poverty levels have drastically [decreased since the 1820s](https://ourworldindata.org/extreme-poverty-in-brief) 

<img src="/blog/blog-10/extreme_poverty.png" alt="Stacked area chart showing the global share of the population living in extreme poverty (orange) versus not in extreme poverty (purple) from 1820 to 2018. In 1820, over 75% of people lived in extreme poverty. This share steadily declined over the centuries, with a rapid drop after 1990, falling to below 10% by 2018. The chart highlights a historical global shift toward rising living standards and reduced poverty." width="500" style="text-align: center; margin: auto;"/>

- The child mortality rate has plummeted since the 1800s (https://www.statista.com/statistics/1041693/united-states-all-time-child-mortality-rate/)

<img src="/blog/blog-10/child_mortality.png" alt="Line chart showing the global child mortality rate (deaths per 1,000 live births) from 1800 to 2020. The graph begins with a high rate around 460 in 1800 and shows a gradual decline through the 19th century. A sharper decline occurs in the 20th century, dropping to 100 by 1940. By 1960, the rate is marked at 31, and continues to fall steadily to below 30 by 2020. The line is smooth with a few fluctuations around the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The y-axis ranges from 0 to 500, and the x-axis spans from 1800 to 2020 in decade intervals." width="500" style="text-align: center; margin: auto;"/>


Experientially too, a number of things have improved in the last century, womens rights have increased, I as a brown person am probably living in one of the best times as I ever could've in berlin - that isn't a lie, things aren't perfect, there's racist nonsense that does occasionally happen and I do have to work harder than the average individual here, but that doesn't mean my life isn't....amazing – Its not like half the time I am not lying in my bed watching amazing, spectacular movies online that I couldn't have had access to just a few years in the past, and I am still, constantly hanging around friends, going to these freaking unbelievably lovely vietnamese places (vietnamese food is the best food, period) that, the government does ensure follow health standards

We have made it through worse, We have crossed bigger hurdles in the past, We can cross this one too, We cured smallpox, the average person does no longer live in extreme poverty, Less people are killing each other, Far far fewer children are dying. There's alot more examples of this that I can add to this article for the future, but at the end of the day

Yes we must fight, but we are doing much much better than we have ever done before.
