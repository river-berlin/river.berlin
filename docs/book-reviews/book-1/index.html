(Japanese proverb)</p></blockquote> <p><sub>- Haidt, Jonathan. The Happiness Hypothesis: Finding Modern Truth in Ancient Wisdom (p. 92). Basic Books. Kindle Edition.</sub></p> <p>or, maybe - and this is an extrapolation, and jonathan doesn't explicitly say this, but my therapist did - maybe it doesn't matter who is right or wrong, maybe all that matters is trying to reach a compromise with someone else, and finding a way to make things work out with other people ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p> <p>Jonathan also posits looking at other human beings and everything else from a more <em>optimistic</em> angle, and how that can be a huge motivation towards actually following through and doing things to go further</p> <p>Lastly, Jonathan's arguments towards altruism, and a rejection of temporary happiness measures (such as buying that big car, or rolex watch) - and push towards virtue ethics (ethics are a habit - i.e. on the elephant, not the rider), did make alot of sense to me holistically and are important points I do take away from this additionally</p> <h3 id="thingsiwishjonathanwouldlookintomore">Things I wish Jonathan would look into more</h3> <p>like I said, this is my first "book takeaway" article, but I really do wish psychologists studying the Indian culture looked further into the caste system and spoke more to individuals from lower-caste backgrounds, and multiple backgrounds in India, in my experience, well - from reading 2 psychology books (this, and polysecure) - I do wish both Jonathan and Jessica Fern would look into writings from individuals of lower caste backgrounds to be able to get a more holistic portrait of Hinduism</p> <h3 id="overall">Overall</h3> <p>I loved the book, I might refine this review in the future, or not, not sure, I think this book has made me aware of quite a few aspects of human behavior that do help me guide and choose the path I wish to choose better</p> <p>I do appreciate the effort Jon made into writing this book alot, thanku :)</p></div></div><!--]--><!--]--><!--]--><!--]--> <!--[--><!--]!--><!--]-->
