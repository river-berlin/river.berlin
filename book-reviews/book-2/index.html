<p>super newbie reviewer? take-awayer? here, so, the writing here is probably not perfect</p>
<p>I think i should take a creative writing course on udemy or something, hmm…</p>
<p>This takeaway contains spoilers from the book</p>
<h3 id="stuffiamtakingawayfromthebook">Stuff I am taking away from the book</h3>
<p>I love this book, so so much, this book is so - human, 
here are some quotes from it that I felt were important that I noted down</p>
<ul>
<li>The grown-ups never understand anything by themselves, and it is tiring for the children to always give them explanations.</li>
<li>I wanted to know if she was really understanding. But she always said, "It's a hat." So I did not talk to him about boa snakes, virgin forests, or stars. I put myself within reach. I told him about bridge, golf, politics and ties. And the grown-up was very happy to know such a reasonable man.</li>
<li>When the mystery is too impressive, we do not dare to disobey.</li>
<li>Big people like numbers. When you tell them about a new friend, they never question you about what's important. They never tell you, "What is the sound of his voice, what games he prefers, does he collect butterflies?" They ask you, "How old is he, how many brothers does he have, how much does he earn, how much does his father earn?"</li>
<li>It's sad to forget a friend. </li>
<li>Children must be lenient towards grown ups</li>
<li>If someone likes a flower that only exists in the millions of stars, that's enough for him to be happy when he looks at them. He says to himself: "My flower is there somewhere …" But if the sheep eats the flower, it is for him as if, suddenly, all the stars were extinguished! And it does not matter that!</li>
<li>We must demand of each one what everyone can give, "said the king. Authority rests first on reason. If you order your people to go to the sea, they will make the revolution. I have the right to demand obedience because my orders are reasonable.</li>
<li>you only see well with the heart. What is essential is invisible to the eye.</li>
<li>It's the time you lost for your rose that makes your rose so important.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="otherthingsiamtakingaway">Other things I am taking away</h4>
<ul>
<li>Sunsets are beautiful</li>
<li>Be compassionate to yourself, this is all quite challenging</li>
