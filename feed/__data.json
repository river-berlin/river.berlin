such a significant pace, that nearly nobody is able to keep up and build effective tooling that will last on the longer run\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>A common trope that has come up now is that implementation details are constantly missing features due to the rapid progress of change within the industry, this has mad it very hard for developers to keep up with the progression of change, and thus, broken software has become a norm\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Changes here are quite evident in the mannerism where\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>\u003Cp>The standard for representation of \"how to prompt\" has constantly changed throughout, \u003Ca href=\"https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/tasks/prompting\">older models simply took in a prompt parameter\u003C/a>, newer models have alternative systems of \"system messages\" and \"user messages\" (\u003Ca href=\"https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Devstral-Small-2505#transformers\">see here\u003C/a>) - oh, and system messages themselves in

it vllm? – what is the best tool to use can be a mind boggling experience\u003C/p>\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Cp>The underlying architecture itself has been significantly changing, leading to a lack of

practical purposes – You will have to likely fine tune a model to the task you are trying to use since most models come with severe lag due to the amount of time it takes to \"load\" the context into a model, which can be heavy if a signficant amount of long context is present/needs to be trained on\u003C/p>\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ol>\n\u003Cp>The bottom line here is that, smaller companies or newly
