been influenced via the exact same factors and commited the exact same form of harm, even if you believe differently, since you would have been similarly influenced in those circumstances, and come to similar conclusions to taking the same actions they made\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>We still should seperate people that are commiting harm towards society, but recognition of determinism (if you believe so), only leads to the conclusion that if we work on changing people's circumstances, perhaps helping people psycologically – even if the same things were to happen to us, i.e. we are influenced via the
