and push towards virtue ethics (ethics are a habit - i.e. on the elephant, not the rider), did make alot of sense to me holistically and are important points I do take away from this additionally\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"thingsiwishjonathanwouldlookintomore\">Things I wish Jonathan would look into more\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>like I said, this is my first \"book takeaway\" article, but I really do wish psychologists studying the Indian culture looked further into the caste system and spoke more to individuals from lower-caste backgrounds, and multiple backgrounds in India, in my experience, well -
